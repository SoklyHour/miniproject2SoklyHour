### Mini Project 2

## Description

This project will be using Pandas dataframes. The objective is to formulate five questions and provide answers based on the five graphs from the ai_job_market_insights.csv datasets. This exercise will familiarize you with working with datasets, posting questions, researching APIs, and gathering datasets.

The dataset I used focuses on the job role, industry, company size, location, required skills, salary, and more in order to answer questions made up for the assignment.

I used ai_job_market_insights.csv datasets to answer the following questions:


## Getting Started

You will need to download the 'ai_job_market_insights.csv' from Kaggle.com in order to use the same dataframes as the project intended.
* [ai_job_market_insights.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/ai-powered-job-market-insights)

[Note]: To ensure the script runs correctly, please place the ai_job_market_insights.csv file in the same directory as the main.py script.

### Dependencies

* How to run the program
  
Run this in the terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Executing program

In the terminal, please type the following:
```
python main.py
```
## Output
This should create 4 graphs in charts to answer all the 4 questions.
